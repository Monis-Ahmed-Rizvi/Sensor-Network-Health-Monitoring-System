# Sensor Network Health Monitoring System

## Overview
This project implements a real-time monitoring system for IoT sensor networks, leveraging machine learning to predict failures before they occur. It provides robust analytics and visualization capabilities for effective sensor network management.

## Features
1. Real-time anomaly detection in sensor data streams
2. Predictive maintenance using machine learning models
3. Interactive dashboard for visualizing sensor statuses and metrics
4. Alerting system for potential failures and anomalies
5. Historical data analysis and trend visualization

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: 
  - Python for ML models and data processing
  - FastAPI for RESTful API development
- **Frontend**: 
  - React for building the user interface
  - D3.js or Chart.js for data visualization
- **Database**: 
  - InfluxDB for time-series data storage
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: 
  - Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
  - Cloud Pub/Sub for real-time data ingestion
  - Cloud Functions for serverless processing
  - BigQuery for large-scale data analysis

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sensor-network-monitoring.git
   cd sensor-network-monitoring
   ```

2. Set up the Python environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up InfluxDB (refer to `docs/influxdb_setup.md` for detailed instructions)

5. Configure GCP services (refer to `docs/gcp_setup.md` for detailed instructions)

6. Start the backend server:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```

7. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

## Key Components
1. **Data Ingestion**: Utilizes GCP Cloud Pub/Sub for real-time sensor data ingestion.
2. **Data Storage**: InfluxDB stores time-series data from sensors.
3. **Machine Learning Models**: Python-based ML models for anomaly detection and failure prediction.
4. **API Layer**: FastAPI provides RESTful endpoints for data retrieval and system management.
5. **Frontend Dashboard**: React-based interface for real-time monitoring and analytics.

## Development Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Use ESLint and Prettier for JavaScript/React code formatting
- Write unit tests for all new features (pytest for backend, Jest for frontend)
- Document all functions and APIs using docstrings and JSDoc
- Use feature branches and pull requests for code reviews

## Deployment
Refer to `deploy/README.md` for detailed instructions on deploying the system to GCP.

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- Use GCP Monitoring for system health checks
- Implement logging throughout the application for easier debugging
- Set up alerts for critical system events and anomalies

## Future Enhancements
- Implement machine learning model retraining pipeline
- Add support for more diverse sensor types
- Enhance predictive capabilities with deep learning models
- Develop mobile app for on-the-go monitoring
